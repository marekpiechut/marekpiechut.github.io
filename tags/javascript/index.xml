Or uses up all available network connections (remember, we only have handful of these) just to wait for failure. Especially if feature is non critical and it does many updates while you are interacting with the app. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nicer if, after failing, app simply stopped trying for some time?</description></item><item><title>One year with React</title><link>https://marekpiechut.github.io/post/2016-09-02-react-lessons-learned/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2016 23:59:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marekpiechut.github.io/post/2016-09-02-react-lessons-learned/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s almost a year now since I&amp;rsquo;m working with React and Flux. After all this time I think I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot about how to build React apps, so they are easy to test, maintain and that components can be easily reused.
Here are some of my most important conclusions. I think following them will make your life really easier, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re just starting with it.
Is it worth it?</description></item></channel></rss>
